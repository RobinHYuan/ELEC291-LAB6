# ELEC291-LAB6

### Introduction:

In this lab, we will be using the PIC32MX170F256B-50I/SP microcontroller, LM335 temperature sensor and DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to meausre current temperature and humidity. The temperature data will be trasmitted from the MCU to a computer to plot a strip chart in real time via serial port using python.
